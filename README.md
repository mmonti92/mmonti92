My name is Maurizio Monti (He/Him), and I'm a researcher in condensed matter physics, currently a postdoc for CNRS in Le Mans. Here you'll find my personal code repository for data processing and analysis and the occasional experiment.
Most of my work is done in Python, though I keep saying that I want to ge back into C++ but I never find the time.
You can find more info about me, my research (and my contact info) [here](https://mmonti92.github.io/).
